# TerminalBot

Simple trading bot written in C++, using the 7, 25, 99 moving average (MA) indicators to trade cryptocurrencies on exchanges.

Currenty only Binance is supported, but you can play with the code freely and implement other exchanges. Please check `inc/binance.h`

Current state: **seems stable but barely tested**

## Disclaimer - please read

This project is a **proof-of-concept** to test Binance API and its features.
Just to see / try if it's possible to make some bucks for cofee (or beer ;).

This software is under development. Unpredictable and unhandled behaviors can happen.

BTW it's one of my C++ learning projects, to get some experience with the language.
Code is messy, and can have lots of non foreseen bugs. Comments can be seen at some points :)

**DO NOT USE** this for your daily trading! You can **lose your money** if something goes wrong!
